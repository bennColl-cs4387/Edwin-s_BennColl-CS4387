Building a software from Github

LibGDX

LibGDX is a jave game enigne I used for a time to create a web-based game. It's been a while since I looked at it, so trying to build the libGDX from the source was interesting. I didn't release how easy it was to fork from a repository. As I was forking and reading their guide to installing from source, it was recommend to install a differnt IDE for this process. So after installing IntelliJ IDE, I tried to clone the LibGDX and had an error with the downloading. (I assume it's because I might still have the application somewhere in my machine.) Thought overall, not a bad experince and will try again later hopeful.
